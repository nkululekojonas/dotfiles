# Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository! This collection of configuration files and scripts help me maintain a consistent and productive development environment across different machines.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nkululekojonas/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install
```
This will create a .config directory in your home directory if one doesn't already exit, this is where all config files will be stored.

## üì¶ Some of What's Inside

- `zshrc`: ZSH shell configuration
- `vimrc`: Vim editor settings
- `tmux.conf`: Tmux terminal multiplexer configuration
- `gitconfig`: Git version control preferences
- `Brewfile`: List of packages to install via Homebrew

This includes some custom functions and personal aliases located in zsh/.

## üõ† Installation

1. Clone this repository to your home directory:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nkululekojonas/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
   ```
2. Run the installation script:
   ```
   cd ~/dotfiles
   ./install
   ```
The install script will symlink the appropriate files to your home directory. Make sure to back up your existing dotfiles before running the script.

## üõ† Dry Run
1. Run the installing script with --dry-run flag
    ```
    cd ~/dotfiles
    ./install --dry-run
    ```
    This will will output the changes that will occur if there are any, this will also report any errors that occur, recommend running this first.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

Feel free to modify these dotfiles to suit your preferences. The main configuration files are:

- `zsh/zshrc` for ZSH settings
- `tmux/tmux.conf` for Tmux configuration
- `vim/vimrc` for Vim configuration
- `git/gitconfig` for Git configuration

After making changes, run `./install` again to update the symlinks.

## TODO

- [ ] Add oh-my-zsh installation 
- [ ] Check for broken symlinks
- [ ] Add a `--help` flag
